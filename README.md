### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I use GitHub to store my portfolio at this moment. It consists of the following projects:
#### [DifEquMaster](https://github.com/VRBarysh/DifEqMaster)
This is a rather large heap of C++ code that I've been piling up for about 20 years. Basically, this is my framework for solving differential equations while controlling the process in real-time and then analysing the results. The equations solved there came from my scientific research. Both my Master's and PhD deegrees works were based on this code as well as a lot of published articles.
  
<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> C++, OOP, mathematical programming, Cauchy problem, Runge-Kutta methods, signal analysis, FFT, thread-based parallel computing, gradient descent and particle swarm optimization


#### [Kaggle-FOG](https://github.com/VRBarysh/Kagge-FOG)
This is a summary of my participation in a Kaggle competition. In this competition we had to analyse time series of accelerometer data to detect an early symptom of Parkinson's disease called freezing of gait. The repository consists of the main project of our team, my own alternative solution project and my silver-winning EDA notebook.  
  
<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> Python, ML, PyTorch, 1D-CNN, sklearn, numpy, pywt, time series analysis

#### [ML-for-car-color-recognition ](https://github.com/VRBarysh/ML-for-car-color-recognition )
This is my solution of a test task where I had to detect cars and classify them by color on pictures. I've achieved over 90% accuracy over 8 color classes (black, blue, green, grey, orange, red, white, yellow) from the test part of the dataset with almost half of the errors corresponding to wrong or questionable labels.

I use the following pipeline here: Single Shot Detector -> Fully convolutional for segmentation -> 2D histogram -> classification

<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> Python, ML, CV, image segmentation, visual object recognition, PyTorch, ResNet, Single Shot Detector, FCN


#### [ML-for-used-car-prices](https://github.com/VRBarysh/ML-for-used-car-prices)
This is one of the training projects that I've created at Yandex Practium data science course. In this project I've used a variety of ML models to predict prices on the used car market.  
  
<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> Python, ML, sklearn, LightGBM, Catboost, pandas, numpy

#### [ML-for-taxi-service-load](https://github.com/VRBarysh/ML-for-taxi-service-load)
This is one of the training projects at Yandex Practicum. Here I use various ML models to decompose and analyse time series to predict future load dynamics for a taxi service.

<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> Python, ML, time series, sklearn, LightGBM, pandas, numpy

#### [CAD-Exchanger-test](https://github.com/VRBarysh/CAD-Exchanger-test)
This is a simple test case to demonstrate modern C++ knoweledge

<ins>Keyword stack:</ins> C++, OOP, STL, OpenMP
