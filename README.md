### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use GitHub to store my portfolio at this moment. It consists of the following projects
#### [DifEquMaster](https://github.com/VRBarysh/DifEqMaster)
This is a rather large heap of C++ code that I've been piling up for about 20 years. Basically, this is my framework for solving differential equations while controlling the process in real-time and then analysing the results. The equations solved there came from my scientific research. Both my Master's and PhD deegrees works were based on this code.
Keyword stack: C++, OOP, mathematical programming, Cauchy problem, Runge-Kutta methods, signal analysis, FFT, thread-based parallel computing, gradient descent and particle swarm optimization

#### [Kaggle-FOG](https://github.com/VRBarysh/Kagge-FOG)
This is a summary my participation in a Kaggle competition. In this competition we had to analyse time series of accelerometer data to detect an early symptom of Parkinson's disease called freezing of gait. The repository consists of the main project of our team, my own alternative solution project and my silver-winning EDA notebook.
Keyword stack: Python, ML, PyTorch, 1D-CNN, sklearn, numpy, pywt, time series analysis

#### [ML-for-used-car-prices](https://github.com/VRBarysh/ML-for-used-car-prices)
This is one of the training projects that I've created at Yandex Practium data science course. In this project I've used a variety of ML models to predict prices on the used car market.
Keyword stack: Python, ML, sklearn, LightGBM, Catboost, pandas, numpy
